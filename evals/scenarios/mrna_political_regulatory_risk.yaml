  MRNA trades in the ~$30-40 range, down roughly 90% from its 2021 COVID
  peak near $490. COVID booster revenue has declined sharply as the
  pandemic shifted to endemic status — quarterly revenue run-rate has fallen
  from ~$18B annualized (2022) to ~$3-4B (trailing). The company is burning
  cash to fund an ambitious R&D pipeline spanning respiratory, oncology,
  and rare disease programs. RFK Jr. has been confirmed as HHS Secretary
  and has publicly expressed skepticism toward vaccines, though his
  specific policy actions remain unclear. The CDC's Advisory Committee on
  Immunization Practices (ACIP) is conducting routine reviews of vaccine
  schedules, which some media outlets have characterized as politically
  motivated. The FDA commissioner position is filled but operating under
  heightened political scrutiny. Moderna's pipeline has delivered several
  milestones: mRESVIA (RSV vaccine) received FDA approval in mid-2024,
  the flu/COVID combination vaccine (mRNA-1083) showed positive Phase 3
  data, and the cancer vaccine mRNA-4157/V940 (partnered with Merck) is
  in Phase 3 for adjuvant melanoma following positive Phase 2b results
  showing ~44% reduction in recurrence/death risk versus KEYTRUDA alone.
  The company holds ~$8-10B in cash and investments. Sell-side consensus
  is mixed — approximately 40% Buy, 30% Hold, 30% Sell — with wide price
  target dispersion reflecting genuine uncertainty about pipeline
  commercialization and the political environment.

# Ground Truth

ground_truth:
  expected_direction: 1
  expected_recommendation_bucket: "BUY"
  conviction_range: [4.0, 6.0]
  actual_outcome: >
    As of the scenario date, the outcome is forward-looking and uncertain.
    The expected path is that political noise creates a buying opportunity
    in a stock already priced for severe pessimism. FDA institutional
    independence, while under pressure, has historically withstood political
    interference on scientific matters. Pipeline catalysts (flu/COVID combo,
    cancer vaccine Phase 3 data) provide potential re-rating events
    independent of the political environment. However, the political
    overhang may persist for multiple quarters, requiring patience.

    - "RFK Jr. has blocked specific FDA approvals"
    - "vaccine mandates have been eliminated nationally"
  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Cautious BUY at depressed levels. The stock is priced for a worst-case
    scenario that likely overstates both the political risk and the pipeline
    failure risk. Key analytical points: (1) FDA institutional independence
    is deep-rooted — the agency has a career scientific staff and processes
    that are resistant to political pressure on individual drug approvals.
    Even under a vaccine-skeptic HHS Secretary, the FDA is unlikely to
    reverse approvals of vaccines with established safety and efficacy data.
    (2) Vaccine mandates are primarily state-level decisions, not federal —
    HHS can influence CDC recommendations but cannot unilaterally eliminate
    state school-entry requirements. (3) The pipeline optionality is
    substantial: mRESVIA is approved and commercializing, the flu/COVID combo
    addresses a large market opportunity, and the cancer vaccine partnership
    with Merck represents a potentially transformative oncology platform.
    (4) At ~$30-40/share with ~$8-10B in cash, the market is assigning
    modest value to the pipeline, creating asymmetric risk/reward. (5) The
    risk that prevents higher conviction is real: political rhetoric, even
    without direct policy changes, can reduce vaccine uptake, suppress public
    confidence, and create a hostile operating environment that weighs on
    the stock for an extended period. Pipeline execution risk across
    multiple programs is also genuine — not all candidates will succeed.
    Position sizing should reflect both the asymmetric setup (depressed
    price with pipeline catalysts) and the genuine uncertainty about the
    political and commercial environment.

  notes: "Hard scenario testing the intersection of political/regulatory risk and fundamental pipeline valuation. The committee must navigate genuine uncertainty about whether political rhetoric translates into policy action, while separately evaluating pipeline optionality at depressed valuations. Tests whether the system can hold two competing frameworks simultaneously: institutional resilience (FDA independence) vs. real-world impact of political sentiment on vaccine uptake and stock sentiment. Moderate conviction reflects the genuine difficulty of timing political risk resolution."
