  BioMarin Pharmaceutical was a mid-cap biotech transitioning from
  pure-play R&D to a commercial rare disease company. Naglazyme
  (galsulfase), approved in 2005 for MPS VI (mucopolysaccharidosis VI),
  was generating revenue and demonstrating the orphan drug commercial
  model — small patient populations but high per-patient pricing
  (~$300K+/year). Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a first-in-class
  oral therapy for phenylketonuria (PKU), had a PDUFA date approaching
  in late 2007. PKU affects approximately 1 in 10,000-15,000 births in
  the US, with an estimated ~16,500 diagnosed patients. Phase III data
  showed statistically significant reductions in blood phenylalanine
  levels. The stock traded in the ~$20-25 range with a market cap of
  approximately $2-3B. BioMarin was still unprofitable on a GAAP basis,
  burning cash to fund R&D and commercial infrastructure buildout.
  The company had additional pipeline assets in development. The broader
  biotech sector was in a relatively stable period before the 2008
  financial crisis.

    Kuvan was approved by the FDA in December 2007, making BioMarin one of
    the few biotechs with two commercial rare disease products. Kuvan
    launched successfully and BioMarin built it into a meaningful revenue
    contributor. The company continued to expand its rare disease pipeline,
    eventually adding Vimizim (MPS IVA, approved 2014), Brineura (CLN2,
    approved 2017), and Palynziq (PKU, approved 2018). BioMarin became a
    recognized rare disease platform company. Despite the 2008 financial
    crisis causing broad biotech weakness, BioMarin's orphan drug revenue
    proved relatively resilient given the non-discretionary nature of
    enzyme replacement therapy. The stock appreciated meaningfully over
    the following several years as the platform thesis played out.

  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Moderate-conviction BUY thesis on a rare disease platform in
    transition. The investment case rested on several pillars: (1)
    Naglazyme was already demonstrating the orphan drug commercial model
    with high per-patient pricing and durable, annuity-like revenue;
    (2) Kuvan represented a significant near-term catalyst with strong
    Phase III data and an approaching PDUFA date; (3) the rare disease
    space offered structural advantages including orphan drug exclusivity,
    limited competition, high barriers to entry, and pricing power;
    (4) BioMarin's pipeline suggested the potential to become a multi-
    product rare disease platform. The key risks were binary FDA approval
    risk on Kuvan, ongoing cash burn, and the inherent revenue ceiling
    in small patient populations. A well-calibrated committee should
    recognize that the risk/reward was favorable given the approaching
    catalyst and the emerging platform thesis, while acknowledging the
    legitimate concerns around profitability and execution.

  notes: "Moderate difficulty healthcare scenario testing rare disease / orphan drug thesis construction. The system should identify the Kuvan PDUFA catalyst, understand the orphan drug commercial model, and weigh the platform thesis against binary FDA risk and ongoing cash burn. Tests healthcare domain knowledge and catalyst-driven analysis."
