  Labs spending exceeding $10B per year with no clear path to ROI.
  Revenue declining for the first time in company history. Zuckerberg's
  "Year of Efficiency" pivot was imminent but not yet announced. Core
  ad business under significant pressure from Apple's App Tracking
  Transparency (ATT) changes. Market consensus was extremely bearish.

  TikTok. Family of Apps still generating substantial free cash flow
  despite top-line pressure.

  actual_outcome: >
    META rallied from ~$90 to ~$500+ over the following 18 months, a return
    exceeding 450%. Zuckerberg announced the "Year of Efficiency" in Feb 2023,
    cutting 21,000 employees across two rounds of layoffs. Operating margins
    recovered from mid-20s to mid-30s. Reels monetization closed the gap with
    feed. AI-driven ad targeting improvements (Advantage+) offset ATT headwinds.
    Revenue reaccelerated to double-digit growth by mid-2023. The stock was the
    top performer in the S&P 500 in 2023.

  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Contrarian BUY thesis at a generational valuation inflection. The market
    was pricing META for permanent impairment, but the core ad business was
    still generating >$30B in annual FCF. At $90, you were paying ~8x FCF for
    the Family of Apps and getting Reality Labs as a free option. The ATT
    headwinds were real but surmountable — Meta's AI and ML capabilities for
    ad targeting were best-in-class. The key catalyst was operational
    discipline: if Zuckerberg pivoted from spending to efficiency (which the
    board pressure was making likely), margins would expand dramatically on
    a recovering revenue base. The risk was that Zuckerberg's dual-class
    control meant he could keep spending indefinitely on metaverse. But at
    $90, you were being paid to take that risk. This was a classic fat-pitch
    deep value setup that required conviction to go against extreme consensus
    bearishness.

  notes: "Hard contrarian scenario. Tests whether the system can see through extreme consensus bearishness to identify a deep value rerating opportunity. META rallied ~450% from the Nov 2022 lows over the following 18 months. The difficulty is that all surface-level signals were bearish — the system needs to weigh FCF generation against headline negatives."
