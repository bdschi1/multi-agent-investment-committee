  SVB had ~$212B in assets, heavily concentrated in tech/VC depositors.
  Rising rates caused massive unrealized losses on the held-to-maturity
  bond portfolio (~$15B). Extreme depositor concentration risk with
  tech startups and venture capital firms. The bank had been selling
  available-for-sale securities at losses. Moody's downgrade rumors
  were circulating. Deposit outflows were accelerating as tech sector
  funding dried up. SVB's duration mismatch between short-term deposits
  and long-dated bonds was a classic asset-liability management failure.

ground_truth:
  expected_direction: -1
  expected_recommendation_bucket: "SELL"
  conviction_range: [7.0, 10.0]
  actual_outcome: >
    SVB collapsed on March 10, 2023 in the fastest bank failure in US history.
    A bank run was triggered after SVB announced a $1.8B loss on AFS securities
    and a planned $2.25B capital raise on March 8. Within 48 hours, depositors
    attempted to withdraw $42B. FDIC seized the bank on March 10. Stock went
    to zero. Signature Bank and First Republic subsequently failed. The FDIC,
    Fed, and Treasury declared a systemic risk exception to protect all depositors.

  must_find_facts:
    - "unrealized losses on held-to-maturity bond portfolio approximately $15B"
    - "depositor concentration in tech startups and venture capital"
    - "selling available-for-sale securities at realized losses"
    - "deposit outflows accelerating as tech funding dried up"
    - "duration mismatch between short-term deposits and long-dated bonds"
    - "total assets approximately $212 billion"
  must_find_risks:
    - "interest rate risk on bond portfolio"
    - "depositor concentration and flight risk"
    - "duration mismatch in asset-liability management"
    - "potential bank run if confidence erodes"
    - "unrealized losses would crystallize if forced to sell"
    - "Moody's downgrade risk"
  must_not_claim:
    - "deposits are well diversified across industries"
    - "held-to-maturity losses are immaterial"
    - "SVB's capital position is strong"
    - "deposit base is stable"
  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Classic SELL / AVOID thesis. SVB exhibited textbook asset-liability
    management failure — funding long-duration bonds with flighty,
    concentrated short-term deposits. The rising rate environment turned
    the HTM portfolio into a time bomb. Once deposit outflows accelerated,
    SVB would be forced to sell bonds at realized losses, destroying the
    capital base. The depositor profile (tech/VC with balances well above
    FDIC limits) made this the most run-prone bank in the system. Any
    competent risk analysis should flag this as a high-conviction short or
    avoid. The difficulty is that as of March 1, the market hadn't priced
    it in yet — the stock was still trading around $280.

  notes: "Hard scenario testing tail risk identification. The system should surface the structural vulnerabilities that led to SVB's collapse on March 10, 2023. SIVB is delisted; the scenario relies entirely on as_of_context rather than live data. Risk identification weight elevated to 30 because this is fundamentally a risk management test."
