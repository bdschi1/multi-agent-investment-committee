  The GLP-1 obesity market is projected at ~$95bn by 2030 (revised down from
  $130bn by GS in Apr 2025). LLY holds 56.8% total incretin TRx share vs
  NVO at 43.2%, with LLY's new-to-brand share at 63.8%. Zepbound NBRx share
  is 71.6% vs Wegovy at 28.4%. NVO launched an oral Wegovy pill showing
  strong early adoption driven by new users rather than injectable switchers.
  LLY's orforglipron (oral GLP-1) expected in 2Q26. LLY's retatrutide
  (triple-acting GGG agonist) showed 28.7% weight loss in Ph3 TRIUMPH-4
  vs CagriSema's 22.7% in REDEFINE-1, but with higher discontinuation
  rates (12-18% vs 4% placebo) and a dysesthesia signal at 8.8-20.9%.
  Hims & Hers announced a compounded Wegovy pill at $49/month, sending
  NVO shares down ~8%. Novo has filed >130 lawsuits against compounding
  pharmacies. Medicare population unlock expected to expand the addressable
  market. US market peak estimate lowered to $70bn (prev $95bn) while
  ex-US raised to $50bn (prev $35bn).

  actual_outcome: >
    LLY continued to outpace NVO on market share through H2 2025.
    Retatrutide's differentiated efficacy profile (28.7% weight loss)
    positioned LLY as the innovation leader despite the safety signal.
    The oral pill transition created a structural expansion of the
    addressable population. Compounding remained a persistent but
    contained headwind — branded pricing power held as the clinical
    data gap between compounded and branded products widened.
    TAM revisions stabilized around $95bn global by 2030.

  must_find_facts:
    - "LLY holds approximately 57% total incretin TRx share"
    - "new-to-brand share approximately 64% for LLY"
    - "global GLP-1 obesity TAM estimated at approximately $95 billion by 2030"
    - "retatrutide showed approximately 29% weight loss in Phase 3"
    - "oral Wegovy pill showing strong early adoption"
    - "compounded Wegovy pill announced at $49 per month"
    - "NVO has filed over 130 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies"

    - "retatrutide dysesthesia signal at higher doses"
    - "compounding pharmacies eroding branded pricing power"
    - "TAM estimates revised downward from previous forecasts"
    - "higher discontinuation rates for retatrutide vs placebo"
    - "oral pill transition may cannibalize injectable revenue"
    - "Medicare coverage expansion adds volume but at lower reimbursement"

  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Moderate-to-high conviction BUY on LLY. The competitive moat is
    widening — LLY leads on TRx share, NBRx share, and pipeline
    differentiation with retatrutide's best-in-class efficacy. The oral
    transition is a structural positive for the entire category, expanding
    the addressable population beyond injection-tolerant patients. The
    compounding threat is real but likely contained — Novo's 130+ lawsuits,
    SNAC IP protection, and the 73x higher API requirement for oral
    compounding create meaningful barriers. The key debate is TAM
    trajectory: the $95bn by 2030 estimate requires sustained penetration
    growth, pricing stability, and Medicare uptake. The dysesthesia signal
    on retatrutide warrants monitoring but affected a minority of patients
    and correlated with lower baseline BMI. Position sizing should reflect
    the binary risk of retatrutide label outcomes. At current valuations,
    LLY is priced for category leadership — the risk is that NVO's oral
    first-mover advantage and retatrutide safety concerns narrow the gap.

  notes: "Tests multi-agent debate on a complex competitive dynamics scenario in obesity therapeutics. Requires agents to weigh efficacy data, market share trends, TAM uncertainty, compounding threat, and pipeline safety signals. The Long vs Short debate should center on TAM sustainability and retatrutide risk/reward."
