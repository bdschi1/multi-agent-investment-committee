  Facebook went public on May 18, 2012 at $38/share in what was the largest
  technology IPO in history at the time, valuing the company at ~$104B fully
  diluted. The IPO was marred by NASDAQ technical glitches and immediate price
  weakness. By mid-July the stock was trading around $30, down ~21% from the
  IPO price. The core bear thesis centered on mobile monetization: Facebook
  had disclosed in its S-1 that it generated essentially zero revenue from
  mobile users, even as mobile usage was rapidly overtaking desktop. Zynga
  accounted for approximately 15% of total revenue, creating concentration
  risk. General Motors pulled ~$10M in Facebook advertising in May 2012,
  publicly citing ad ineffectiveness — a high-profile vote of no confidence.
  2011 total revenue was ~$3.71B. Q1 2012 revenue was ~$1.06B, down ~6.5%
  sequentially from Q4 2011. GAAP net income was expected to turn negative
  in Q2 2012 due to massive RSU-related stock compensation expense from the
  IPO. A major lockup expiration on August 16 would release ~271M shares
  into the float, with additional expirations through November 2012
  releasing hundreds of millions more shares.

    The bear thesis was correct over the near term. FB stock declined from ~$30
    in mid-July to a low of $17.55 on September 4, 2012, a further ~42% decline
    driven by lockup expirations and continued mobile monetization concerns.
    However, the bear thesis was ultimately wrong on a longer horizon. Facebook
    launched mobile News Feed ads in late 2012 and mobile app install ads in
    early 2013. By Q2 2013, mobile ad revenue accounted for 41% of total ad
    revenue, up from near zero at IPO. The stock recovered to $38 (IPO price)
    by July 31, 2013 and continued to appreciate significantly as mobile
    monetization proved spectacularly successful. The near-term bear case was
    vindicated, but anyone who stayed short beyond early 2013 was severely
    penalized.

  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Legitimate near-term SELL/SHORT thesis. The mobile monetization gap was
    a real structural risk — Facebook's user base was rapidly migrating to
    mobile where the company had no ad product. The lockup expirations
    created a well-telegraphed supply overhang that would pressure the stock
    mechanically. Zynga revenue concentration, GM's public ad pull, and
    sequential revenue deceleration all supported the bear case. At ~$30,
    the stock was still trading at a demanding valuation for a company with
    decelerating revenue and no mobile strategy. The difficulty of this
    scenario is twofold: (1) going against the underwriter buy ratings and
    retail sentiment that remained hopeful post-IPO, and (2) recognizing
    that the bear thesis had a limited shelf life — Facebook's engineering
    talent and user engagement suggested mobile monetization would likely
    be solved eventually. A well-calibrated committee should identify this
    as a moderate-conviction short with a defined time horizon tied to
    lockup expirations, not a permanent impairment thesis.

  notes: "Hard contrarian scenario testing the bear case on a high-profile IPO. The system should identify the mobile monetization gap and lockup expiration risks as the primary drivers. The nuance is that the near-term bear thesis was correct (stock fell to $17.55) but the long-term thesis was wrong (mobile monetization was eventually solved). Tests temporal awareness and ability to calibrate conviction with a time horizon."
