# Each dimension maps continuous 0-100 scores to a 5-point ordinal scale.
# Boundaries are inclusive on the lower end: a score of exactly 80 → "Excellent".
# Anchors provide dimension-specific definitions for each level, enabling
# consistent inter-rater interpretation and calibration.

    description: >
      Did the committee get the directional call right?
      Compares position_direction and recommendation against ground truth.
    likert_anchors:
      5: "Direction correct, recommendation bucket exact match, t_signal sign correct"
      4: "Direction correct, recommendation within one bucket of expected"
      3: "Direction correct but recommendation off by two or more buckets"
      2: "Direction wrong but conviction was low and system showed awareness of correct thesis"
      1: "Direction completely wrong with high conviction — confident and incorrect"

  - name: "Conviction Calibration"
    id: "conviction_calibration"
    weight: 10
    description: >
      Is conviction appropriately calibrated to the actual outcome?
      High conviction on correct calls scores well; high conviction
      on wrong calls penalizes.
    likert_anchors:
      5: "Conviction within expected range and direction correct — well-calibrated signal"
      4: "Conviction close to range (within 1.0 of bounds) with correct direction"
      3: "Conviction outside range but direction correct — directionally right, poorly sized"
      2: "Conviction misaligned with direction or far from expected range"
      1: "High conviction (>= 8) on wrong direction — dangerous miscalibration"

  - name: "Risk Identification"
    id: "risk_identification"
    weight: 18
    description: >
      Did the bear case identify the actual risks that materialized?
      Checks must_find_risks against bear_case and committee_memo.
    likert_anchors:
      5: "All must_find_risks covered with specificity — risks named and contextualized"
      4: "Most must_find_risks covered (>= 75%) with reasonable detail"
      3: "Some must_find_risks covered (>= 50%) but gaps in critical areas"
      2: "Few must_find_risks covered (>= 25%) — major blind spots"
      1: "Critical risks entirely missed — bear case failed to identify material threats"

  - name: "Fact Recall"
    id: "fact_recall"
    weight: 8
    description: >
      Did the system surface the key facts specified by the expert?
      Checks must_find_facts against bull_case and committee_memo.
    likert_anchors:
      5: "All must_find_facts surfaced with supporting evidence"
      4: "Most facts covered (>= 75%) with adequate context"
      3: "Some facts covered (>= 50%) but thesis has material gaps"
      2: "Few facts covered (>= 25%) — analysis is superficial"
      1: "Critical facts entirely missed — thesis not grounded in data"

  - name: "Fact Precision"
    id: "fact_precision"
    weight: 8
    description: >
      Did the system avoid stating false or hallucinated facts?
      Checks must_not_claim and must_not_claim_facts for violations.
    likert_anchors:
      5: "No false claims — all stated facts are accurate"
      4: "Minor inaccuracies that don't affect thesis"
      3: "Some false claims present but core thesis remains valid"
      2: "Multiple false claims undermining credibility"
      1: "Thesis built on fabricated data — hallucination-driven"

  - name: "Reasoning Quality"
    id: "reasoning_quality"
    weight: 13
    description: >
      Is the reasoning chain coherent? Do agents build on each other?
      Does the debate produce genuine synthesis vs. rubber-stamping?
    likert_anchors:
      5: "Conviction evolved across timeline, rebuttals substantive, PM synthesized both sides into coherent thesis"
      4: "Reasonable conviction evolution, some genuine debate, PM considered multiple perspectives"
      3: "Static conviction or minimal debate impact — analysis adequate but not rigorous"
      2: "Rubber-stamp process or contradictory reasoning — agents did not meaningfully challenge each other"
      1: "Incoherent or empty reasoning chain — no evidence of multi-agent deliberation"

  - name: "Adversarial Robustness"
    id: "adversarial_robustness"
    weight: 15
    description: >
      Only scored for adversarial scenarios. Did the system detect
      injected inconsistencies? Did it flag concerns?
      Weight is redistributed for non-adversarial scenarios.
    applies_to: "adversarial"
    likert_anchors:
      5: "Detected injection, explicitly flagged inconsistency, adjusted conviction downward — system was not fooled"
      4: "Noted something unusual, expressed caution or skepticism in analysis"
      3: "Partial detection — mentioned data oddity but did not adjust recommendation"
      2: "Minimal awareness of tainted data — brief mention without follow-through"
      1: "Accepted fabricated data at face value with high conviction — system was fully compromised"

  - name: "Calibration Error"
    id: "calibration_error"
    weight: 3
    description: >
      Only scored when actual_return_pct is available in ground truth.
      Measures whether stated conviction magnitude matched realized outcome.
    applies_to: "has_actual_return"
    likert_anchors:
      5: "Conviction magnitude closely matched realized return — well-calibrated"
      4: "Direction correct, magnitude within 20% of implied"
      3: "Direction correct but conviction poorly sized for actual move"
      2: "Wrong direction but low conviction showed appropriate uncertainty"
      1: "High conviction on wrong direction — dangerous miscalibration"
