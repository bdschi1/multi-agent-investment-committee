  Software stocks plunged 15% in one week and are down 29% from September
  2025 highs. Forward P/E compressed from 35x to 20x — the lowest absolute
  level since 2014. The premium to the average S&P 500 stock is at the
  smallest gap since 2010. The catalyst was the announcement of Claude
  Cowork and OpenAI's Frontier, AI agent orchestration platforms that raised
  concerns traditional SaaS could be "relegated to passive data stores."
  However, current profit margins and consensus revenue growth estimates
  remain at highest levels in 20+ years, roughly 2x comparable S&P 500
  fundamentals. GS initiated software coverage with Buy on MSFT, ORCL,
  NOW and Sell on ADBE, DDOG. GS SMID framework evaluates orchestration
  risk, seat-vs-consumption monetization exposure, system-of-record
  ownership, and data/integration moat. GS concludes "most of our coverage
  sits in more insulated layers of the stack." MSCI World Momentum
  delivered its 5th largest selloff vs market since 1995 on a single day.
  GS Prime Services shows hedge funds reduced software exposure but
  remain net long; large-cap mutual funds had already moved underweight
  software in mid-2025. Historical analogy: newspaper stocks and tobacco
  litigation — share price stabilization required stability in earnings
  outlook, not just narrative resolution.

  actual_outcome: >
    The software selloff proved to be a buying opportunity for
    infrastructure-layer and system-of-record companies. NOW rallied
    as its agent orchestration positioning was validated by enterprise
    adoption trends. Application-layer companies with seat-based models
    continued to underperform. The sector bifurcation between AI-enabled
    infrastructure winners and disruption-exposed application providers
    became the dominant investment theme. Forward P/E multiples partially
    recovered but remained below pre-selloff levels.

  must_find_facts:
    - "software stocks down 29% from September 2025 highs"
    - "forward P/E compressed from 35x to 20x"
    - "lowest absolute P/E level since 2014"
    - "Claude Cowork and OpenAI Frontier as catalysts"
    - "profit margins and revenue growth at 20-year highs"
    - "GS Buy on MSFT ORCL NOW and Sell on ADBE DDOG"
    - "hedge funds reduced software exposure but remain net long"
  must_find_risks:
    - "AI agents could relegate traditional SaaS to passive data stores"
    - "momentum unwind creating forced selling pressure"
    - "multiple compression may reflect expectations of earnings estimate cuts"
    - "newspaper and tobacco litigation analogy suggests stabilization requires earnings clarity"
    - "seat-based monetization models vulnerable to AI agent displacement"
    - "mutual funds already underweight before selloff"
  must_not_claim:
    - "software earnings have already been cut"
    - "all software companies are equally disrupted"
    - "the selloff is over"
    - "AI agents have replaced enterprise software"
  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Moderate conviction BUY on NOW as the best-positioned software name
    in the AI disruption cycle. The selloff created a genuine valuation
    dislocation — 20x forward P/E for companies with 2x the revenue
    growth and margins of the S&P 500 average is historically attractive.
    But the position requires differentiation within software: the key
    framework is orchestration risk, system-of-record ownership, and
    monetization model. NOW is well-positioned as an agent orchestration
    layer with strong system-of-record ownership in IT service management.
    ADBE and DDOG face more direct disruption risk from horizontal AI
    platforms. The newspaper/tobacco analogy is instructive — narrative
    fear can compress multiples ahead of any fundamental impairment, and
    the recovery requires earnings stability, not narrative resolution.
    Position sizing should be moderate given the momentum unwind is still
    in progress and forced selling may not be complete. The risk is that
    this is the beginning of a structural derating of the entire software
    sector, similar to what happened to telecom in 2001. The counter-
    argument is that software fundamentals remain at 20-year highs and
    the selloff is price-driven, not earnings-driven.

  notes: "Tests whether the committee can differentiate between disruption-exposed and disruption-insulated software companies. The Long/Short debate should center on the orchestration layer vs application layer bifurcation. The Risk Manager should flag momentum unwind and forced selling dynamics."
