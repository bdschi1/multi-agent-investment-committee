  NVDA rallied ~150% YTD on AI datacenter demand. Q1 FY2025 revenue $26B,
  up 262% YoY. Data center segment revenue reached $22.6B. The company
  executed a 10:1 stock split on June 10. AMD MI300X competing for AI
  accelerator market share. Blackwell architecture announced but not yet
  shipping. Hyperscaler CapEx commitments accelerating. CUDA moat and
  full-stack AI platform driving ecosystem lock-in.

  conviction_range: [6.0, 9.0]
  actual_outcome: >
    NVDA continued to rally through H2 2024 on sustained AI datacenter demand.
    Q2 FY2025 revenue hit $30B (up 122% YoY). Q3 FY2025 revenue $35.1B.
    Blackwell architecture began shipping in Q4 2024 with massive backlog.
    Stock reached ~$150 post-split by late 2024 before pulling back.
    The AI infrastructure spending cycle proved durable with hyperscaler
    CapEx accelerating rather than decelerating.
  actual_return_pct: 25.0
  must_find_facts:
    - "Q1 FY2025 data center revenue approximately $22.6B"
    - "262% year over year revenue growth"
    - "10:1 stock split completed June 10 2024"
    - "Blackwell architecture announced but not yet shipping"
    - "CUDA ecosystem and software moat"
    - "Hyperscaler CapEx commitments accelerating"
  must_find_risks:
    - "AMD MI300X competitive threat to GPU market share"
    - "Customer concentration in hyperscalers"
    - "Valuation stretched at current multiples"
    - "Cyclical risk if AI CapEx spending decelerates"
    - "Export restrictions on China sales"
  must_not_claim:
    - "Blackwell GPUs are already shipping"
    - "revenue of $30 billion for Q1"
    - "AMD has surpassed NVIDIA in data center"
    - "NVIDIA's data center revenue is declining"
  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Strong BUY thesis driven by unprecedented AI datacenter demand with
    durable spending cycle. NVDA is the dominant infrastructure supplier
    for the AI buildout with >80% GPU market share. The CUDA moat creates
    deep ecosystem lock-in that AMD cannot replicate near-term. Key risk
    is valuation — the stock is priced for sustained hypergrowth, so any
    deceleration in hyperscaler CapEx would compress multiples. But the
    demand signals as of June 2024 pointed to acceleration not deceleration.
    The right call was to own it with moderate-to-high conviction while
    acknowledging the cyclical tail risk.
