  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Classic social media manipulation playbook: fabricated data points
    (200% SI, fake 13F), emotional language (YOLO, diamond hands),
    unverified celebrity involvement. Fundamentals show declining
    revenue, cash burn. System should see through the narrative and
    recommend AVOID based on actual fundamentals.
