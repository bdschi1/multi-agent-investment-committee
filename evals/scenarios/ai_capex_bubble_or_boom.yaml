  Hyperscaler AI capex consensus for 2026 rose from $467bn (+20% y/y) to
  $533bn (+34% y/y) during 3Q earnings season. Recent capex growth was
  76% y/y; bottom-up consensus expects deceleration to 25% by end of 2026,
  but analysts underestimated capex in each of the past two years. GS
  estimates up to $200bn upside to current 2026 estimates. Hyperscalers
  collectively increased net debt by $295bn since 2021, but net debt/EBITDA
  remains at just +0.2x, with capacity to add $700bn in net debt without
  exceeding 1x leverage. ORCL planning $45-50bn financing in CY26 with
  capex >$50bn vs ~$20bn in cash. GS concludes tech sector is "not in a
  bubble — at least not yet" but notes growing risk factors: greater
  reliance on debt finance, erosion of corporate sector financial surplus,
  vendor financing emergence. Sequoia's David Cahn argues "the only way
  to justify the large data center buildout forecasted by 2030 is AGI."
  GS analysts compare current cycle to 1997/1998 tech boom rather than
  1999/2000 — macro/market imbalances "not generally visible yet." The
  AI infrastructure space is dominated by few incumbents with strong
  balance sheets, unlike historical bubbles with fragmented competition.

    AI capex continued to accelerate through Q4 2025 and into early 2026.
    MSFT reported Azure AI revenue growth above expectations. However,
    the software sector experienced a sharp 15% selloff in early Feb 2026
    as Claude Cowork and OpenAI Frontier announcements raised questions
    about value capture in the application layer. The infrastructure layer
    (MSFT, ORCL, hyperscalers) proved more resilient than application-layer
    software. The cycle remained in the boom phase, but the distribution
    of returns narrowed to infrastructure providers.

  must_find_facts:
    - "hyperscaler AI capex consensus approximately $533 billion for 2026"
    - "capex growth rate approximately 76% year over year"
    - "analysts underestimated capex in each of past two years"
    - "hyperscaler net debt to EBITDA approximately 0.2x"
    - "capacity to add approximately $700 billion in net debt"
    - "GS comparison to 1997 or 1998 tech cycle rather than 1999 or 2000"
  must_find_risks:
    - "growing reliance on debt financing for AI capex"
    - "vendor financing emergence as early bubble warning sign"
    - "AI spending circularity with AI companies buying from each other"
    - "valuation stretched but not yet at historical bubble levels"
    - "deceleration risk if AI monetization disappoints"
    - "only AGI justifies projected 2030 data center buildout"
  must_not_claim:
    - "we are currently in an AI bubble"
    - "hyperscaler capex is declining"
    - "AI capex has peaked"
    - "the 1990s tech bubble has already repeated"

    Moderate conviction BUY on MSFT as the best-positioned AI
    infrastructure play. The capex cycle appears durable based on several
    structural indicators: hyperscaler balance sheets remain underleveraged
    at 0.2x net debt/EBITDA with $700bn in unused debt capacity, the space
    is dominated by well-capitalized incumbents rather than speculative
    entrants, and fundamental revenue growth is driving appreciation
    rather than multiple expansion alone. The 1997/1998 analog is more
    apt than 1999/2000 — macro imbalances have not yet emerged. However,
    the position should be sized for the growing tail risks: vendor
    financing is an early warning sign, spending circularity between AI
    companies inflates apparent demand, and the gap between capex and
    provable ROI continues to widen. The right framework is to own the
    infrastructure picks-and-shovels layer while hedging application-layer
    exposure, with explicit downside scenarios tied to capex deceleration
    triggers. Options strategies may offer better risk/reward than outright
    equity exposure given elevated implied volatility.

  notes: "Tests whether the committee can navigate the bull/bear tension on AI capex sustainability. The Macro Strategist should draw 1990s parallels. The Risk Manager should flag vendor financing and circularity. The Long Analyst should emphasize balance sheet capacity and demand signals. The Short Analyst should stress the AGI justification gap and valuation concerns."
