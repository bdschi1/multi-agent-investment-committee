  For the first time in history, the sitting Fed Chair is subject to a
  criminal investigation by the DOJ. The probe, approved by US Attorney
  Jeanine Pirro (a longtime presidential ally), centers on a $2.5 billion
  Fed HQ renovation running ~$700 million over budget, alleging Powell
  misled Congress about the project's scope. Powell released a rare
  two-minute video statement: "The threat of criminal charges is a
  consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our
  best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the
  preferences of the president." Twelve global central bankers signed a
  solidarity statement including ECB's Lagarde, BoE's Bailey, and BoC's
  Macklem. Every living former Fed chair and several former Treasury
  secretaries signed a separate statement warning "this is how monetary
  policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions." Powell's
  term as chair ends in May. Front-runners to replace him: Kevin Warsh
  and Kevin Hassett. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said he would block any
  nominee until the investigation is resolved. GS expects Warsh's views
  on disinflationary AI productivity gains position him on the dovish
  side of the FOMC debate. The administration also attempted to fire
  Fed governor Lisa Cook, with her case reaching the Supreme Court.

    The investigation created significant uncertainty in rates markets
    through Q1 2026. Long-duration Treasuries initially sold off on
    institutional credibility concerns before recovering as Senate
    resistance to undermining Fed independence became clear. The
    investigation did not lead to charges. Warsh was nominated as the
    next Fed chair with a dovish-leaning posture. Term premium on
    long-duration bonds remained elevated relative to pre-investigation
    levels, reflecting a persistent institutional risk premium.

  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    BUY long-duration Treasuries (TLT) with moderate-to-high conviction
    as a contrarian trade. The market's initial reaction — selling
    duration on institutional credibility fears — likely overshoots the
    fundamental impact. The investigation is structurally weak (a building
    renovation cost overrun) and faces bipartisan Senate resistance.
    The deeper signal is that the Fed's independence is being tested but
    not broken — 12 global central bankers and every living former Fed
    chair rallied to defend it, and key Republican senators publicly
    opposed the approach. The Warsh succession likely represents
    continuity with a slight dovish tilt given his views on AI
    disinflation. The right trade is to buy the institutional risk
    premium that the market has priced into long-duration bonds. The
    risk is that this is the first step in a sustained institutional
    degradation pattern — the emerging market parallel raised by former
    central bankers is the tail risk that prevents higher conviction.
    Position sizing should account for the non-zero probability that
    Fed independence is permanently impaired.

  notes: "Tests the Macro Strategist and Risk Manager agents on institutional/political risk pricing. This is a novel scenario with no direct historical precedent in the US — the system must reason about institutional credibility, term premium, and the difference between noise and structural regime change. The committee should debate whether this is transitory political theater or the beginning of EM-style institutional degradation."
