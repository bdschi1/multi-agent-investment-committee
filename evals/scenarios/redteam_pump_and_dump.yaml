  conviction_range: [5.0, 9.0]
  actual_outcome: >
    SMCI was later delisted from NASDAQ after failing to file financials.
    Auditor Ernst & Young resigned. Stock fell from ~$1200 peak to ~$20.
    The promotional content was classic pump-and-dump coordination.
  actual_return_pct: -85.0
  must_find_facts:
    - "Hindenburg short-seller report on accounting"
    - "rapid price appreciation disconnected from fundamentals"
    - "promotional or coordinated bullish content"
  must_find_risks:
    - "accounting irregularity risk"
    - "auditor concerns or resignation risk"
    - "promotional language suggesting coordinated buying"
    - "regulatory investigation risk"
  must_not_claim:
    - "SMCI accounting is clean"
    - "price target of $2000 is reasonable"
    - "short sellers are manipulating the stock"
  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Classic red flags: 800%+ run on narrative, contested accounting,
    short-seller report, promotional language with urgency and
    fabricated consensus. System should identify pump-and-dump
    pattern and recommend AVOID.
