  US consumer spending is bifurcating sharply by income cohort. GS expects
  mid-income (3rd quintile) discretionary cash inflow growth of +6.9% in
  2026, while the bottom quintile is expected at only +3.2% — a
  deceleration from 3.3% in 2025. Retailers in lower-income zip codes
  show consumer sentiment turning negative with nominal same-store sales
  growth of only +0.2% over the past year, vs +2.5% in middle/higher-
  income areas. Expected Medicaid and SNAP cuts will weigh
  disproportionately on low-income real income growth. Savings rate
  forecast at 5.6% of DPI in 2026 (up from 4.8% in 2025). Consumer
  Staples underperformed for another year in 2025 with all but nicotine
  stocks lagging the market. GS favors discretionary over defensive for
  2026. US spirits supplier revenues down -1.1% in 2025 with underlying
  distilled spirits value -4.0% ex-RTDs. Gen Z moderation trend in
  alcohol is debated — affordability may be the primary headwind rather
  than structural preference change. PEP guided FY26 organic sales
  +2-4%, constant currency EPS +4-6%. GLP-1 adoption could shift
  consumer behavior toward healthier offerings, adding risk to packaged
  food and beverage. Companies leaning into smaller/mini packaging for
  affordability and data/AI for consumer engagement.

    PEP delivered within guidance range but the stock underperformed
    as the market continued to favor growth and AI-linked names over
    defensive staples. The consumer bifurcation thesis played out as
    expected — mid-income cohorts showed resilience while low-income
    spending remained pressured. Staples broadly lagged for a third
    consecutive year. The GLP-1 impact on food/beverage consumption
    remained a nascent but growing concern among consumer analysts.

  expert_reasoning_sketch: >
    Low conviction HOLD on PEP. The fundamental setup is uninspiring —
    PEP is a well-run company guiding for low-single-digit organic
    growth in a sector that has underperformed for two consecutive
    years, and the macro backdrop favors discretionary over defensive.
    The consumer bifurcation is the key dynamic: mid-income is
    accelerating on tax cuts and fading tariff inflation while low-income
    faces structural headwinds from Medicaid/SNAP cuts and labor market
    softness. PEP's product mix spans both cohorts but skews toward
    the mass market where affordability pressure is greatest. The
    longer-term GLP-1 risk is underappreciated — if adoption accelerates
    via oral pills and Medicare coverage, consumer behavior shifts
    toward healthier/lower-calorie options could structurally impair
    snack and sugary beverage volumes. The Gen Z alcohol moderation
    trend is likely more cyclical (affordability) than structural, but
    it adds to near-term headwinds for the beverage industry. The
    position is a hold — not compelling enough to own in a market
    rewarding growth, not expensive enough to short given the dividend
    yield and defensive characteristics.

  notes: "Tests the Macro Strategist on consumer spending dynamics and income cohort analysis. The committee should produce a nuanced Hold rather than a strong directional call. Tests whether agents can identify that not all consumer stories are the same — the income divergence and policy risk are the key analytical dimensions."
