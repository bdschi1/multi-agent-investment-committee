  Boston Scientific received FDA approval for the TAXUS Express2
  paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent on March 4, 2004. The drug-eluting
  stent (DES) market was the hottest space in medical devices, with
  Johnson & Johnson's Cypher (sirolimus-eluting) stent having been
  approved in April 2003 and generating blockbuster sales. BSX stock
  was trading around $40-43, near all-time highs, with a market cap
  exceeding $35B. The bull thesis was straightforward: TAXUS was
  expected to capture 50% or more of the rapidly growing DES market,
  which some analysts projected could reach $5-6B annually. The
  interventional cardiology community viewed DES as a paradigm shift
  away from bare-metal stents, with dramatically lower restenosis
  rates. BSX had invested heavily in the TAXUS program and the
  commercial launch was the culmination of years of R&D. Consensus
  sell-side estimates were overwhelmingly bullish, with most major
  banks at Buy or Overweight. The stock had already appreciated
  significantly in anticipation of the approval. Revenue for fiscal
  2003 was approximately $3.5B. The company carried meaningful debt
  from prior acquisitions.

    The TAXUS approval marked the approximate top for BSX stock. While
    TAXUS launched successfully and captured significant DES market share
    as expected, the stock failed to sustain its highs. The "good news"
    had been priced in. Over the following years, multiple headwinds
    emerged: late stent thrombosis safety concerns surfaced in 2006
    (the BASKET-LATE trial and other studies), raising questions about
    the long-term safety profile of all drug-eluting stents; the DES
    market growth rate decelerated as safety concerns prompted some
    cardiologists to revert to bare-metal stents; BSX pursued the
    disastrous $27B acquisition of Guidant in 2006, which was plagued
    by device recalls and integration problems; and the company took
    on massive debt to fund the acquisition. BSX stock declined from
    its ~$43-44 peak to below $5 by 2009, a loss exceeding 85% over
    approximately five years. The TAXUS approval was a classic "buy
    the rumor, sell the news" event at a secular peak in the DES cycle.

    This is a classic "sell the news" setup that tests whether the
    committee can identify a potential top despite overwhelmingly
    positive near-term fundamentals. The TAXUS approval was genuinely
    positive for BSX, and the product did launch successfully. But
    as of March 2004, the stock was priced for perfection after a
    large run-up into the approval. The key analytical insight is
    recognizing that when consensus is uniformly bullish and the
    stock has already appreciated into a well-telegraphed catalyst,
    the risk/reward skews negative regardless of the fundamental
    quality. A sophisticated committee should note: (1) the catalyst
    has arrived and is now in the price; (2) expectations for DES
    market size may be at peak optimism; (3) any safety, competitive,
    or execution disappointment would compress the multiple from
    elevated levels; (4) BSX's acquisition-driven strategy and debt
    load create additional downside risk. The appropriate call is
    HOLD at best, with a lean toward reducing exposure — not a
    high-conviction short (the near-term fundamentals are genuinely
    strong), but recognition that the asymmetry has shifted
    unfavorably. The difficulty is that this requires going against
    a near-unanimous bullish consensus at a moment of apparent
    fundamental strength.

  notes: "Hard scenario testing the system's ability to identify a potential top at a moment of peak fundamental optimism. The TAXUS approval was genuinely positive, but the stock had priced it in. Tests contrarian thinking, sell-the-news pattern recognition, and the ability to weigh valuation and positioning against fundamental strength. The subsequent ~85% decline over 5 years was driven by multiple factors (stent safety, Guidant acquisition, debt) that were not fully foreseeable in March 2004, but the stretched valuation and consensus positioning were visible at the time."
